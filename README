Using the project

Add new currencies to the src/main/resources/currencies.json file. All props are required. 
	Ideally use ISO-4217 codes for currency symbols
	
Add exchange rates in the src/main/resources/currencyConvertersConfig.json
	Specify the source currency (srcCurrency) is the one to which the rate will be applied to obtain the target currency
	
See /shopicalc/src/test/java/shopicalc/ShoppingCartTests.java for sample usage


Improvements
	Use a real logging framework rather than standard out
	Make objects immutable - skipped in this exercise to make the code less verbose
	Implement singleton pattern using an IoC container
	Config files (currencies, converters) could be fed dynamically (eg. from a web service, or via cmd line)
